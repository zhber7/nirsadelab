									<h3>Physiological and biochemical traits associated with domestication and the effects of climate change on a perennial cereal grain</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									<b>Intermediate wheatgrass (<i>Thinopyrum intermedium</i>; IWG) is one of the promising perennial grains for sustainable agriculture. The cultivation of perennial grains has been suggested as a complementary strategy to the cultivation of traditional annual grains. Reduced soil erosion, nitrogen leakage and carbon dioxide emissions are a few of the environmental advantages of perennial grains over annual grains.</b> 
								</p>
								<p>
									<b>In the last decade, the domestication of IWG has accelerated, mainly toward high yield and other important agronomic traits. Nevertheless, studies in other cereals have shown that domestication has a negative impact on plant resilience to abiotic stress, especially on water-use efficiency. Due to increasing extreme weather events that are exacerbating world food insecurity, it is crucial to understand and enhance the abiotic-stress tolerance of IWG. Due to IWG’s complicated genome, phenotyping is still very helpful in revealing those plant traits. High-throughput phenotyping (HTP) techniques are advanced and novel tools for evaluating the physiological traits of complex plants.</b>
								</p>
								<p>
									<b>We have set up cutting-edge HTP physiological systems for theaccurate and precise characterization of water-use efficiency. Those systems include a gravimetric-based system (known as Plant-Ditech) and a gas-exchange system (known as LICOR6800). We have integrated the experimental setup and data analysis for those systems, to be used in our own research as well as by other members of the department (see intra-departmental collaboration).</b> 
								</p>
								<p>
									<b>In this study, we analyzed how the domestication of IWG has influenced the plant’s physiological behavior in response to Mediterranean abiotic stress, specifically drought stress. Using continuous data from the HTP regarding the plant’s water management and growth in a semi-controlled environment together with other physiological data, we identified different trends between plants’ breeding cycles. It seems that the last cycle of domestication reduced its shoot/root ratio in reaction to drought. In contrast, during earlier cycles, a high shoot/root ratio was maintained.</b>

									<h3 style="position:relative; top:280px"> Improving tomato yield and fruit quality by enhancing source/sink relationships through the regulation of chloroplast stability</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									<b style="position:relative; top:280px">Chloroplast are the main source for production of both carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) in plants. Several  pathways are involved in the regulation of source/sink capacity and C/N assimilation both under well water and stress conditions: (I) CELL WALL INVERTASE  (CWINV) will enhance sink capacity and carbon fluxes from leaves to fruits; (II) CHLOROPLAST VESICULATION (CV) can degrade chloroplasts, accelerating C- and N-allocations to the sinks (Sade et al., 2018b) and (III) Inhibition of CV under stress will delay stress induced  chloroplast degradation and enhance C/N assimilation and source capacity. Increasing the C and N assimilation during vegetative growth and stress episode(s) and increasing the C/N allocation to the fruit during development and plant senescence are both beneficial traits for fruit quality.</b>
								</p>
								<p>
									<b style="position:relative; top:280px">Although both traits can potentially increase fruit production and quality, they are potentially antagonic unless they are timed correctly and research aimed at their expression, but avoiding deleterious effects, is required. Moreover, a better understanding of the genetic components that control C/N allocation especially under stress is needed. Our hypothesis is that the combination of (i) enhancing the source C/N capacity throughout the growth season and stress episode and (ii) maximizing  the C/N source to sink allocation at fruit development will result in higher fruit productivity and better fruit quality.  Thus, while enhancing source C/N capacity and source to sink allocations will enhance plant growth and development, the induction of CV  in the source leaves and CWINV in fruits - during fruit maturation – will increase sugar loading in the fruit (and increase the fruit %Brix). </b>
								</p>
								<p>
									<b style="position:relative; top:280px">We will therefore design and transform tomato plants with multiple genes constructs comprising  two different genes cassette: 1) CRISPR/Cas 9 system targeting SlCV for the generation of knockout; this will enhance the source capacity during stress and  2) DEX::CV (Chemically induced expression of CV; that is not targeted by CRISPR/Cas 9) for synchronized activation of CV during fruit maturation and increased C/N allocation. Moreover, those transgenic plants will be generated on the background of a near isogenic line IL9-2-5 which have a strong CWINV fruit activity and presented enhance sink capacity. In addition to the detailed characterization of the transgenic plants  source/sink relationship and yield component, those plants will be further studied using system biology approach to better understand the molecular and genetic components that regulate the allocation of C/N from source to sink (e.g., sugar and amino acid transporters)</b>

									<h3>A Systems-biology approach to elucidating the metabolic pathways for the abiotic-stress tolerance of wild emmer wheat</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									<b style="position:relative; top:200px">One major focus in agriculture today is enhancing crop productivity under stress conditions (e.g., drought, heat and salinity). This is a major concern due to many factors, including intensifying climate change (e.g., changing rain and evaporation patterns), anthropogenic desertification (due to grazing and the overuse of existing agricultural habitats) and the increasing human population with a rising standard of living. One way towards solve this snowballing problem is to discover genes and pathways associated with abiotic-stress tolerance.</b>
								</p>
								<p>
									<b style="position:relative; top:200px">Wild relatives of crop plants are a rich source for novel stress-resistance genes. Since wild plants have been dealing evolutionarily with biotic and abiotic stresses for millennia, their genomes contain many genes related to resistance, which can be introduced into domesticated crop species. Traditionally, this has been done through wide crossing andvigorous and continuous breeding schemes.</b>
								</p>
								<p>
									<b style="position:relative; top:200px">In the past few decades, plant transgenesis has facilitated this process tremendously, saving time, money and resources. In the past 20 years, the Omics age has emerged, allowing the relatively cheap generation of high-throughput data in genomics and metabolomics. One major setback to this revolution is the human inability to manually process this much data. Therefore, many are turning to statistics and computational biology to bridge this data-analysis gap.</b>
								</p>
								<p>
									<b style="position:relative; top:200px">In this project, we are utilizing the unique genetic materials of the Institute for Cereal Crop Improvement (ICCI) and a Systems Biology approach that brings together traditional physiological experiments with Omics (i.e., genomics, metabolomics and microbiomics) involving computational and statistical methods (e.g., machine learning and correlation network analysis) to uncover previously unknown genes and pathways associated with resistance to drought and salinity stress in wild and domesticated wheat.</b>

									<h3 style="position:relative; top:550px;"> Physiological and molecular mechanisms controlling root hydraulic conductivity and root-to-shoot gas-exchange signaling in <i>Setaria viridis</i> under variable environmental conditions</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									<b style="position:relative; top:550px">Grasses (e.g., the <i>Panicoideae</i> subfamily, which is particularly important for agriculture) sprout crown roots from their shoots. While the sustained growth and branching of those roots allows for optimal soil exploration, the water permeability of those roots (in other words, root hydraulic conductivity) favors the radial transfer of water from the soil for subsequent transport to the shoot. Nevertheless, the molecular and physiological mechanisms that regulate root hydraulics are poorly understood.</b>
								</p>
								</section>
								<section id="project4b">
								<p>
									<b style="position:relative; top:550px;">Aquaporins (AQPs; water-channel proteins) facilitate the transport of water across root cell membranes. AQPs could be main effectors of radial crown-root water transport (alongside other as yet unknown regulators). Although they represent a key point for the adaptation of wild plant species to diverse natural habitats and are a major target for crop improvement, the signaling mechanisms that link soil properties with root hydraulics and AQP functions remain largely unknown, especially in grasses.</b>
								</p>
								<p>
									<b style="position:relative; top:550px">The main goal of this project is to gain better understanding of the physiological and molecular mechanisms controlling root hydraulic conductivity and root-to-shoot gas-exchange signaling (e.g., water use efficiency). The work will be conducted in the model cereal plant <i>Setaria viridis</i> under variable environmental conditions. Using physiological (i.e., gas exchange and root hydraulics), molecular (i.e., gene editing, expression analysis), biochemical (i.e., AQP inhibitors, protein‒protein interaction) and cellular (i.e., cell water permeability and cell localization) tools, we have identified a unique AQP (designated PIP1;6) which is a  candidate for the regulation of root hydraulics and shoot gas exchange.</b>
